### Current Market Gap
Most Canadian SMEs use 3-5 different software tools:
- QuickBooks (accounting) - lacks Canadian compliance features

### Our Competitive Advantage
- **Canadian-first design** with built-in compliance
- **Unified platform** reducing software costs and complexity
- **SME-focused pricing** and feature set
- **Local data hosting** for privacy compliance
